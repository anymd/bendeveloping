<h1>My Background</h1>


<p></p>
<p>I love technology, always have.  I bought my first computer, an <%= link_to "Atari 800", "http://oldcomputers.net/atari800.html" %>, in 1983 with Bar Mitzvah money.  I still have it and used it to build this web site.  Just kidding.</p>
<p>I spent hundreds of hours typing in programs from computing magazines and was amazed by what was possible.  I had a tape cassette drive for storage and a dot matrix printer that I turned into a scanner using some parts from Radio Shack.</p>
<p>Eventually I got my first external hard drive, a Rana 1000, which changed everything. No more waiting five minutes for programs to load! It didn't take long before I got my first 300 baud modem and was dialing into BBS's to swap games and communicate with strangers.</p>
<p>Although I pursued a degree in the humanities, my first job out of college was with a small software company called Gnossos Software.  It was 1993.  My roommate at the time was working in the White House (Clinton administration) and gave me a tour of the West Wing.  It was there that I saw my first web site - WhiteHouse.gov - running in Netscape. I had been an AOL and Compuserve subscriber for a few years by that point so it all clicked immediately.  I could tell this was something that was going to change the world.</p>
<p>I remember seeing which domain names were available at the time, and if I remember correctly, they were free.  Names like business.com were commonly available.  Had I known how valuable these were to become, well, you know.</p>
<p>I soon taught myself HTML and proposed to my boss that I build our first web site.  It was purely static but I was very proud none-the-less.</p>
<p>Every job I've pursued and had since then has been with small companies creating web-based software and services.  I quickly moved up the Product Management chain but always enjoyed rolling up my sleeves and diving in to engineering discussions.  I've spend thousands of hours with engineers, discussing database designs, information architecture, intricate details of website behavior, back-end scaling requirements, integrating with APIs, processing massive amounts of data, you name it.  It was only a matter of time before I got the bug to learn how to code myself.</p>
<p>I've spent years teaching myself various web technologies and have been dozens of web sites.  A few years ago I decided to dive whole hog into learning programming fundamentals and began going through online and offline tutorials.  I attended local meetups.  One of them is called Railsbridge, which is an organization of volunteers that gather monthly to help anyone looking to learn Ruby and Rails.  It was at a Railsbridge meetup that I learned about Dev Bootcamp, an intensive 9-week web development course on programming fundamentals, OOP, databases, front/back-end technologies, APIs, background jobs, AJAX, TDD, pair programming, and all facets of web development.  It was life changing.</p>
