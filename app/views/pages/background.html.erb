<h1>My Background</h1>


<p></p>
<p>I love technology, always have.  I bought my first computer, an <%= link_to "Atari 800", "http://oldcomputers.net/atari800.html" %>, in 1983 with Bar Mitzvah money.  I still have it and used it to build this web site.  Just kidding.</p>
<p>I spent hundreds of hours typing in programs from computing magazines and was amazed by what was possible.  I had a tape cassette drive for storage and a dot matrix printer that I turned into a scanner using some parts from Radio Shack.</p>
<p>Eventually I got my first external hard drive, a Rana 1000, which changed everything. No more waiting five minutes for programs to load! It didn't take long before I got my first 300 baud modem and was dialing into BBS's to swap games and communicate with strangers.</p>
<p>Although I pursued a degree in the humanities, my first job out of college was with a small software company called Gnossos Software.  It was 1993.  My roommate at the time was working in the White House (Clinton administration) and gave me a tour of the West Wing.  It was there that I saw my first web site - WhiteHouse.gov - running in Netscape. I had been an AOL and Compuserve subscriber for a few years by that point so it all clicked immediately.  I could tell this was something that was going to change the world.</p>
<p>I remember seeing which domain names were available at the time, and if I remember correctly, they were free.  Names like business.com were commonly available.  Had I known how valuable these were to become, well, you know.</p>
<p>I soon taught myself HTML and proposed to my boss that I build our first web site.  It was purely static but I was very proud none-the-less.</p>
<p>Every job I've pursued and had since then has been with small companies creating web-based software and services.  I quickly moved up the product management chain, gaining higher levels of responsibility.  But all along, what really got me excited...where my real passion lied was solving technical problems with the engineers.</p>
<p> I've spend thousands upon thousands of hours working with some amazing engineers, discussing database designs, information architecture, intricate UI details, back-end scaling requirements, integrating with APIs, processing massive amounts of data, providing hooks for future requirements on the product roadmap, you name it.  It was only a matter of time before I got the bug to learn how to code myself.</p>
<p>I've spent years teaching myself various web technologies and have built dozens of web sites.  A few years ago I decided to dive whole hog into learning programming fundamentals and began going through online and offline tutorials.  I attended local meetups.  One of them is called Railsbridge, which is an organization of volunteers who gather monthly to help anyone looking to learn Ruby and Rails.  It was at a Railsbridge meetup that I learned about Dev Bootcamp, an intensive 9-week web development course on programming fundamentals, OOP, databases, front/back-end technologies, APIs, background jobs, AJAX, TDD, pair programming, and all facets of web development.  I applied, got accepted (15% acceptance rate), and attended as soon as they could take me.  It was life changing.</p>
<p>After graduating from Dev Bootcamp, I sought out an apprenticeship to gain some professional development experience.  I landed a three-month gig at Funny Or Die in San Mateo, CA, working with some of the best engineers I've encountered.  This time though, I was not the product manager, I was coding right beside them.  I loved every minute of it and knew I had made the right decision.</p>
<p>Since Funny Or Die I have been working on my own projects, teaching myself new things every, reading books, attending meetups, blogging, consulting, and looking for full time work. I am very excited for things to come!</p>
